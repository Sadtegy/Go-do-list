# Go Do List

A simple command-line to-do list application written in Go. This project is primarily for learning and practicing the Go programming language. As I learn new concepts, I plan to add more features to this application.

## Getting Started

This guide will help you get the Go Do List up and running on your local machine. It also includes instructions on how to install Go if you haven't already.

### Prerequisites

* **Go Installation:** You need to have Go installed on your system to run this application.

### Installation

#### 1. Install Go (if you haven't already)

Follow the official Go installation guide for your operating system:

* **Windows:** [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/) - Download the `.msi` installer and follow the instructions.
* **macOS:** You can use Homebrew: `brew install go`. Alternatively, download the `.pkg` installer from the official website.
* **Linux:** Follow the instructions specific to your distribution on the official website: [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install).

After installation, verify that Go is installed correctly by opening your terminal or command prompt and running:

```bash
go version 1.24.2
